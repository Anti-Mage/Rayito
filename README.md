Rayito
======

These are simple ray tracing tutorials, proceeding in stages to help learners
start simple.  They are designed to help provide enough infrastructure to get
going right away, but not so much that the learner isn't force to experiment
and try things out on their own.

It is highly encouraged to start with stage 1, and experiment with it and try
to understand it.  Then move on to the next stage, do the same, and so forth.

Stage 4 is, for now, the same as stage 3, and is where the most experimentation
should happen.

Don't be afraid to break things, crash, etc.  It's good for the soul!
