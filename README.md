Rayito
======

These are simple ray tracing tutorials, proceeding in stages to help learners
start simple.  They are designed to help provide enough infrastructure to get
going right away, but not so much that the learner isn't force to experiment
and try things out on their own.

It is highly encouraged to start with stage 1, and experiment with it and try
to understand it.  Then move on to the next stage, do the same, and so forth.

Stage 4 is, for now, the same as stage 3, and the Qt version is for those
who want to have a GUI to experiment with.  Stage 5 and onward will use the
Qt GUI.

Don't be afraid to break things, crash, etc.  It's good for the soul!
